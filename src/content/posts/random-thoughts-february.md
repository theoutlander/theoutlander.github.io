# Random Thoughts: February 2024

Sometimes I have thoughts that don't warrant a full blog post but are still worth sharing. Here's what's been rattling around in my brain lately.

## Tech Stuff

### Why Do We Still Use Passwords?
Seriously, it's 2024. We have biometrics, hardware keys, and magic links. Why are we still typing `Password123!` into forms?

I spent 30 minutes yesterday trying to remember which variation of my password I used for some random service. The one with the exclamation mark? The one with the number at the end? The one that's 8 characters vs 12?

We've solved harder problems than this.

### The "It Works on My Machine" Problem
I've been thinking about this phrase a lot lately. It's become a meme, but it's actually a deep problem.

When someone says "it works on my machine," they're not being lazy. They're experiencing a real phenomenon where the same code behaves differently in different environments.

The solution isn't to mock them. It's to understand why their environment is different and fix the underlying issue.

### TypeScript Generics Are Getting Out of Hand
I saw this in a codebase the other day:

```typescript
type ExtractRouteParams<T extends string> = string extends T
  ? Record<string, string>
  : T extends `${infer _Start}:${infer Param}/${infer Rest}`
  ? { [K in Param]: string } & ExtractRouteParams<`/${Rest}`>
  : T extends `${infer _Start}:${infer Param}`
  ? { [K in Param]: string }
  : {};
```

I understand what it does. I can explain it to someone else. But I refuse to believe this is the best way to solve the problem.

## Life Stuff

### The Coffee Shop Test
I have a theory about coffee shops. The quality of a coffee shop is inversely proportional to how many people are working on laptops there.

The best coffee shops have:
- No WiFi
- Uncomfortable chairs
- Loud music
- People actually talking to each other

The worst coffee shops have:
- Free WiFi
- Power outlets everywhere
- Silent, focused workers
- The sound of typing

I'm not sure what this means, but I'm pretty sure it's profound.

### Why Do We Apologize for Everything?
I caught myself apologizing to a vending machine yesterday. It didn't give me my snack, and I said "sorry" to it.

We apologize for:
- Being late (even when it's not our fault)
- Asking questions
- Taking up space
- Having opinions
- Existing

Stop it. Apologize when you've actually done something wrong. Otherwise, you're just devaluing the word.

### The Paradox of Choice
I spent 15 minutes in the grocery store yesterday trying to pick out a box of cereal. There were 47 different options.

I ended up buying the same brand I always buy.

More choices don't make us happier. They make us anxious. We think we want options, but we actually want someone else to make the decision for us.

## Work Stuff

### Meetings Are Not the Problem
Everyone complains about meetings, but meetings aren't the problem. Bad meetings are the problem.

A good meeting:
- Has a clear purpose
- Has the right people
- Ends with decisions
- Has follow-up actions

A bad meeting:
- Has no agenda
- Has too many people
- Goes in circles
- Accomplishes nothing

Stop canceling meetings. Start making them better.

### The "Busy" Trap
I used to wear "busy" as a badge of honor. Look how important I am! I'm so busy!

Now I see "busy" as a red flag. If you're always busy, you're probably:
- Not prioritizing well
- Not delegating enough
- Not saying no to things
- Not working efficiently

Being busy is not the same as being productive.

### The Imposter Syndrome Paradox
The people who worry about imposter syndrome are usually the ones who don't have it.

Real imposters don't know they're imposters. They think they're doing great.

If you're worried about being an imposter, you're probably doing fine.

## Random Observations

### Why Do We Clap When Planes Land?
We're not clapping for the pilot. We're clapping for ourselves. We survived another flight.

It's like a collective sigh of relief disguised as appreciation.

### The Elevator Problem
Why do we always look at the floor numbers in elevators? We know what floor we're going to. We know what floor we're on.

Yet we all stare at the display like it's going to change our destination.

### The "Just One More Thing" Phenomenon
Every time I think I'm done with a project, I remember "just one more thing" I need to do.

It's never just one more thing. It's always three more things. And each of those three things has three more things.

This is why projects are never really done.

## The Bottom Line

Life is weird. Work is weird. Technology is weird.

But it's all interesting if you pay attention.

The key is to notice the small things, question the obvious things, and laugh at the absurd things.

And maybe, just maybe, we'll figure out why we apologize to vending machines.
