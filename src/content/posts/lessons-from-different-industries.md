# Lessons from Working Across Industries and Company Sizes

I've been fortunate to work across a wide range of industries and company sizes throughout my career. From early-stage startups to Fortune 500 companies, from independent consulting to building teams from scratch.

Here's what I've learned about what works, what doesn't, and what surprised me along the way.

## The Surprising Similarities

### 1. **People Are People Everywhere**
Whether you're at a 5-person startup or a 50,000-person enterprise, the fundamental challenges are the same:
- How do we communicate effectively?
- How do we make decisions?
- How do we solve problems?
- How do we work together?

The scale changes, but the human dynamics don't.

### 2. **Process is a Tool, Not a Goal**
I've seen startups with more process than enterprises, and enterprises with less process than startups. The key isn't the amount of process - it's whether it serves the people using it.

Good process makes work easier. Bad process makes work harder.

### 3. **Technology is Secondary**
The best technology in the world won't save a bad product or a dysfunctional team. I've seen companies succeed with outdated tech and fail with cutting-edge solutions.

Focus on the problem first, technology second.

## The Key Differences

### **Startups: Speed Over Perfection**
**What works:**
- Ship fast, iterate faster
- Everyone wears multiple hats
- Direct communication
- Quick decisions

**What doesn't:**
- Over-engineering
- Perfect documentation
- Extensive planning
- Bureaucracy

**Example:**
At a startup, I once shipped a feature in 2 days that would have taken 2 weeks at a larger company. It wasn't perfect, but it solved the user's problem and gave us valuable feedback.

### **Enterprises: Scale Over Speed**
**What works:**
- Robust architecture
- Comprehensive testing
- Clear documentation
- Standardized processes

**What doesn't:**
- Moving too fast
- Skipping steps
- Individual heroics
- Ad-hoc solutions

**Example:**
At a Fortune 500, I learned that a 2-hour outage could cost millions. The extra time spent on testing and monitoring wasn't overhead - it was insurance.

### **Consulting: Adaptability Over Consistency**
**What works:**
- Understanding client context
- Flexible approaches
- Quick learning
- Clear communication

**What doesn't:**
- One-size-fits-all solutions
- Rigid methodologies
- Assuming you know best
- Over-promising

**Example:**
I once had to completely change my approach mid-project when I realized the client's constraints were different than I initially understood. Flexibility saved the engagement.

## Industry-Specific Lessons

### **Healthcare: Compliance is Non-Negotiable**
- HIPAA, FDA regulations, and patient safety are not suggestions
- Documentation isn't optional - it's required
- Testing isn't just about bugs - it's about lives
- Change management is critical

### **Finance: Trust is Everything**
- Security isn't just about technology - it's about trust
- Auditing and compliance are features, not afterthoughts
- Performance matters more than in most industries
- Risk management is built into everything

### **E-commerce: User Experience is Revenue**
- Every millisecond of load time costs money
- A/B testing isn't optional - it's essential
- Mobile isn't the future - it's the present
- Personalization drives conversion

### **Media: Content is King, Technology is the Kingdom**
- Scalability isn't just about users - it's about content
- Real-time matters more than in most industries
- CDNs and caching aren't optimizations - they're requirements
- Analytics drive everything

## The Consulting Perspective

### **What I Learned from Consulting**
1. **Every company thinks they're unique** - They're usually more similar than they think
2. **Context matters more than technology** - The same solution won't work everywhere
3. **Communication is 80% of the job** - Technical skills are table stakes
4. **Clients hire you for your judgment** - Not just your ability to code

### **The Consulting Advantage**
Working as a consultant gave me exposure to:
- Different problem-solving approaches
- Various organizational structures
- Multiple technology stacks
- Diverse team dynamics

This breadth of experience is invaluable when building products or teams.

## The Management Perspective

### **What I Learned from Managing Teams**
1. **Culture eats strategy for breakfast** - No matter how good your plan is
2. **Hiring is the most important thing you do** - Get it wrong and everything else suffers
3. **Process should serve people** - Not the other way around
4. **Communication is a skill** - Not a personality trait

### **Scaling Teams**
- **0-10 people**: Direct communication, everyone knows everyone
- **10-50 people**: Need some structure, but keep it light
- **50+ people**: Process becomes essential, but don't overdo it
- **500+ people**: You need systems, but don't lose the human touch

## The Teaching Perspective

### **Why I Love Teaching**
Teaching forces you to:
- Understand things deeply, not just superficially
- Explain complex concepts simply
- See things from different perspectives
- Stay current with new technologies

### **What Teaching Taught Me**
- **Everyone learns differently** - Adapt your approach
- **Questions reveal understanding** - Listen to what people ask
- **Practice makes permanent** - Not perfect
- **Mistakes are learning opportunities** - Not failures

## The Bottom Line

The most valuable skill I've developed is **adaptability**. The ability to:
- Understand different contexts
- Adjust my approach accordingly
- Learn quickly from new situations
- Apply lessons from one domain to another

Whether you're at a startup or an enterprise, in healthcare or finance, the fundamentals remain the same:
- Solve real problems
- Work with great people
- Learn continuously
- Focus on what matters

The rest is just details.
