# Welcome to My Tech Blog! ðŸš€

Hey there! I'm Nick Karnik, and this is where I share my thoughts on modern web development, engineering practices, and the occasional random musing.

## What You'll Find Here

This blog focuses on the tech stack I work with daily:

- **React & Frontend** - Component patterns, hooks, performance optimization
- **Node.js & Backend** - API design, server architecture, best practices  
- **TypeScript** - Type safety, advanced patterns, tooling
- **Engineering** - Code quality, team practices, system design
- **Random Stuff** - Sometimes I'll share recipes, dating advice, or other life thoughts

## My Approach

I believe in practical, real-world solutions. You won't find theoretical fluff here - just honest takes on what works (and what doesn't) in actual production environments.

## Current Focus

Right now I'm particularly interested in:
- React Server Components and the future of full-stack React
- TypeScript's evolving type system and advanced patterns
- Building scalable Node.js applications
- Engineering culture and team dynamics

## Let's Connect

I'm always up for a good tech discussion. Find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/nickkarnik) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/theoutlander).

Thanks for reading, and welcome to the journey! ðŸŽ‰
