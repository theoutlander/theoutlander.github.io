# Engineering Management: What I Wish I Knew 5 Years Ago

I've been managing engineering teams for 5+ years now. I've made every mistake possible, learned from them (mostly), and figured out what actually works.

Here's what I wish someone had told me.

## The Hard Truths

### 1. **You Can't Make Everyone Happy**
This was the hardest lesson. As an engineer, I was used to solving problems with code. Management problems don't have clean solutions.

Someone will always be unhappy with:
- The tech stack choice
- The project assignment
- The promotion decision
- The meeting schedule

Accept it. Make the best decision you can with the information you have, and move on.

### 2. **Your Job is Not to Code**
This killed me for the first year. I kept trying to jump in and write code when things got tough.

**Stop it.**

Your job is to:
- Remove obstacles
- Make decisions
- Provide context
- Shield your team from politics
- Help people grow

If you're coding, you're not managing.

### 3. **Context is Everything**
Engineers make better decisions when they understand the "why." I used to just tell people what to do.

Now I explain:
- Why this project matters
- How it fits into the bigger picture
- What success looks like
- What happens if we don't do it

Context makes everything easier.

## The Practical Stuff

### 1. **One-on-Ones Are Sacred**
I used to cancel 1:1s when things got busy. Big mistake.

1:1s are where you:
- Build relationships
- Catch problems early
- Give feedback
- Learn what's really happening

**Never cancel them.** Reschedule if you must, but never cancel.

### 2. **Feedback is a Skill**
I used to give feedback like this:
> "Your code quality could be better."

Useless.

Now I do this:
> "I noticed the last three PRs had similar bugs. Let's talk about how we can catch these earlier. What do you think would help?"

Specific, actionable, and collaborative.

### 3. **Hire for Growth, Not Just Skills**
I used to hire people who could do the job immediately. Now I hire people who can grow into bigger roles.

Skills can be taught. Attitude, curiosity, and work ethic are harder to change.

### 4. **Fire Fast, Hire Slow**
This sounds harsh, but it's true. A bad hire affects the entire team. A good hire makes everyone better.

I've kept people too long because I felt bad about firing them. That was selfish. The team suffered because I didn't want to have a difficult conversation.

## The Technical Stuff

### 1. **Architecture Decisions Need Input**
I used to make technical decisions in isolation. Now I involve the team.

- Present the problem
- Share the constraints
- Get input from everyone
- Make the decision
- Explain why

People support decisions they helped make.

### 2. **Technical Debt is a Management Problem**
I used to think technical debt was just a technical issue. It's not.

Technical debt happens because of:
- Unrealistic deadlines
- Lack of planning time
- Pressure to ship fast
- Poor prioritization

Fix the process, not just the code.

### 3. **Documentation is Leadership**
I used to think documentation was boring. Now I see it as leadership.

Good documentation:
- Onboards new people faster
- Reduces questions
- Prevents mistakes
- Shows you care about the team

## The People Stuff

### 1. **Everyone is Different**
I used to manage everyone the same way. That doesn't work.

Some people need:
- More direction
- Less direction
- More feedback
- Less feedback
- More recognition
- More challenge

Learn what each person needs and adapt.

### 2. **Promotions Are Hard**
I used to think promotions were about technical skills. They're not.

Promotions are about:
- Impact on the team
- Leadership potential
- Problem-solving ability
- Communication skills
- Business understanding

Technical skills are table stakes.

### 3. **Conflict is Normal**
I used to avoid conflict. Now I see it as healthy.

Teams that never disagree are:
- Not thinking critically
- Not challenging each other
- Not growing

Encourage healthy conflict. Just make sure it's about ideas, not people.

## The Meta Stuff

### 1. **You're Always Learning**
I thought I'd figure out management and then just do it. Nope.

Every team is different. Every situation is different. Every person is different.

You're always learning, always adapting, always growing.

### 2. **It's About the Team, Not You**
I used to worry about looking good. Now I worry about the team succeeding.

When the team succeeds, you succeed. When the team fails, you fail.

Your job is to make them look good, not the other way around.

### 3. **You Can't Control Everything**
I used to stress about things I couldn't control. Now I focus on what I can influence.

- I can't control company strategy
- I can't control market conditions
- I can't control other teams

I can control:
- How I treat my team
- The decisions I make
- The culture I create

Focus on what you can control.

## The Bottom Line

Management is hard. It's messy. It's emotional. It's rewarding.

The best managers I know are:
- Humble
- Curious
- Empathetic
- Decisive
- Consistent

Be those things, and you'll figure out the rest.
