# About Me

Hello! I'm Nick Karnik, a Senior Engineering Manager and Principal Software Engineer who's passionate about building great products and great teams. Welcome to my personal blog where I share insights on modern web development, engineering practices, and the occasional random thought.

## What I Do

I specialize in taking ideas from zero to one, building high-performing engineering teams, and creating products that users actually want. My expertise spans engineering management, AI integration, and full-stack development with React, Node.js, and TypeScript.

What makes me unique is my diverse experience across industries and company sizes - from early-stage startups to Fortune 500 companies, working with well-known brands and high-profile clients. I've done everything from independent consulting to building teams from scratch, and I love the challenge of adapting to different environments while maintaining high standards.

## My Journey

Over the years, I've had the privilege of working with some incredible people and companies. I've seen how different industries approach technology, learned what works at scale vs. what works in startups, and discovered that the best solutions often come from understanding the unique constraints of each situation.

Whether it's helping a small team move fast or scaling systems for millions of users, I bring the same principles: clear communication, practical solutions, and a focus on what actually matters.
